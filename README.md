# OSCP Report Template - Simplified Formatting

## Overview

The official OSCP exam report template provided by OffSec is comprehensive but structured entirely within a large table. Many find this table-based formatting somewhat difficult to edit directly when writing up extensive findings.

This repository offers an alternative version of the OSCP report template (`.docx` format). The main goal of this version is **ease of editing**:

* The overarching table structure has been removed.
* All necessary sections and headings, as reflected in the official template's Table of Contents, have been retained and formatted as standard document headings.

This allows you to focus on populating the content without fighting table formatting.
